## Our Wonderful Story

1. Once upon a time, there was a **castle**.

2. Then suddenly, a **dragon** appeared… but maybe it was actually a **robot**?  
   (Nobody is sure yet.)

3. After that, everyone got lost (or maybe teleported?) and somehow there was a **treasure chest**.![treasure chest](img/treasure_large.png)
   They opened it and started searching for the treasure chest inside.![treasure open](img/treasure_open.png)

4. Someone found a map, but it had no directions.  
   (TODO: add an image of the map?)
